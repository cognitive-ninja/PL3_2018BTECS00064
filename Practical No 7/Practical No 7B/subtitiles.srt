1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:08,030
the feeling whenever I do something I
feel happy you see this is you try that

2
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:13,920
whatever you may have knowledge you have
sometimes bettering the economy you may

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,310
have better better baby sometime you can
have a kind words you can have so if we

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:27,180
use and make somebody's life happy that
you are giving and his or her life is a

5
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,930

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:46,800
righteousness in the heart there's
beauty in the cat where there is beauty

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,260
in the character there is harmony in the
home harmony in the home where there is

the nation when there is order in the

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:01,559
nation there's peace in the world this
is a starting point where there's a

11
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:07,140
righteousness the heart beauty in the
character harmony the hope and the order

12
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:13,080
in the nation peace in the world
all in one of the others coming so where

13
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:24,380
we start we start the righteous now
remember this incident 1979 1979 slv-3

14
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:30,030
satellite launch vehicle I were the
project director mission director my

15
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,380
mission is to put the satellite in the
orbit thousands of people work nearly

16
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:41,430
ten years I reach the I reach the Surrey
arakata condition the launch pad

17
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,229
countdown was going on
t-minus four minutes t-minus five

18
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:53,490
minutes t-minus two one one minute
t-minus 40 seconds computer put a hold

19
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,860
don't launch it computer say don't
launch it I am the mission director I

20
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:05,479
have to take decision everything is on
behind me there are six experts they saw

21
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:09,210
did a computer database coming in and
screen

22
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:14,070
they see the pictures the screen they
said there's a problem the problem is

23
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:19,200
there's a leakage in a system in the
control system but immediately

24
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,370
calculation no problem
we have got sufficient fuel and oxidiser

25
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:30,780
country control system is contorta
rocket to the record attitude and we can

26
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:37,710
go ahead now of course my experts view
but I took a division problems mine

27
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:43,590
right finally I took a division i bypass
the computer I launched the system okay

28
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,170
and August baseball event first state
you worked in a four stage rocket and

29
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:54,030
second stage got mad it went to spin
instead of putting the satellite in the

30
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,730
orbit it put in the Bay of Bengal

31
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:04,560
1979 it was a failure there's a failed
first time I experienced my failure

32
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,409
how'd he manage the failure success I
can manage so at that time we have great

33
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:17,760
man your great leader also sati stubborn

37
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:34,859

the culprit because I'm the project

38
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:38,909
director Asian director what's at East
Awad said chairman Indian Space Coast

39
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:45,859
what the artist said dear friends we
have failed today he is the first time I

40
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:52,200
have to do all the success all the
failure is I want to support my

41
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:58,200
technologists and scientists and staff
so that next year they succeed so he

42
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:05,340
took the whole range missile and then
media asked you put way off then got so

43
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:10,109
many crows we are putting like that lot
of criticism he received a criticism he

44
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:15,510
assured them in a year will succeed with
our team is a very good team next year

45
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:24,389
here only interesting happened next year
July 18 1980 when he succeeded president

46
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:28,259
said you go and conduct the press
conference do you follow what it means

47
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:32,039
it means when the failure occurred the
leader took it up

48
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:40,770
when the success came he gives to his
team how did you become so great great

49
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:48,860
that's a question well which class you
are singing what's your dream in life

50
00:04:49,039 --> 00:05:11,969
singen well you know give their related
terms so I personally believe you Basava

51
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:20,009
dream say you must I must have a dream
I must continuously acquire knowledge

52
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:31,830
continuously acquire knowledge hard work
hard work and perseverance one should

53
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:43,559
not be a not afraid of problems we
should know how to handle the not only

54
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:48,629
how to handle success how to handle the
failures particularly you are in the

55
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:54,379
management environment return it I want
the young people to understand how to

56
00:05:54,379 --> 00:06:01,379
manage the failure because any tasks you
do you have to come across problem

57
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:06,979
problem should not become the captain of
the individual or a project chief and

58
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:12,479
the project chief should become the
captain of the problems and defeat the

59
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,909
problem at site and for a culture of
excellence the reaction is not by

60
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:25,769
accident it is a process where an
individual continuously strives to

61
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:32,459
better oneself the performance standards
are set by themselves they work on their

62
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:40,919
dreams with focus and are prepared to
take calculated risk and do not get

63
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:47,699
deterred by failures as they move
towards their dreams then this type of

64
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:54,119
their dreams as they tend to reach the
original targets there's tried to work

65
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:59,479
to their potential in the process they
increase their performance there by

66
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:05,999
multiplying further their potential
this is an onion being lifecycle

67
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:12,269
phenomena culture of excellence they are
not in competition with genuine arts but

68
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:19,679
themselves that is a culture of
excellence I'm sure each one of you will

69
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:25,739
aspire to become a unique with culture
of excellence she has written books

70
00:07:25,739 --> 00:07:30,269
you've served as president your
aerospace engineer you've been a

71
00:07:30,269 --> 00:07:35,569
professor but you say the title you like
best is the title of teacher why is that

72
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:42,029
you know I had I had a teacher
I never say young boy ten years boy what

73
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:47,819
am the second world was going on at that
time I used to see in my class fifth

74
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:53,669
class teacher in science teacher he say
mr. subrahmanya he entered to the

75
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:59,610
classroom and abused to see the
radiation of knowledge from radius of

76
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:05,039
knowledge from him when he enters the
classroom my teacher I see a radiation

77
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:12,809
of purity of life and he's the way he
thought I my dream has got shaped what

78
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:18,989
should be my way of life he's the person
the teacher gave me the vision of my

79
00:08:18,989 --> 00:08:24,539
life when I was a young fellow now a
teacher has got a fantastic opportunity

80
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:31,739
to grow minds to enrich the minds and
you the dreams to the young people and

81
00:08:31,739 --> 00:08:35,639
nurture the dreams with them and they
would become a great human being

82
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:40,919
sometime they would become better than
you but better than the teacher so that

83
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,480
happens you to have and also there's a
teacher like what I am doing I am a

84
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,269
professor I can also do the research
young researchers will be work with me

85
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:56,670
that's a great pressure when they get
the PhD history has proven history has

86
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:03,660
proven that those who dare to imagine
the impossible are the ones who break

87
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:12,300
all the human limitations in every field
of human endeavor whether science

88
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:19,930
medicine sports are the technology the
names of the people just know I listed

89
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:23,889
some of the names the names of the
people who imagine the impossible are

90
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:29,680
engraved in our history by breaking the
limits of the imagination by breaking

91
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,949
their limits of their magnet the change
they change the world

92
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:39,000
you take CV Raman you take Newton you
take angsting you take Chandra Shekar

93
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,180
thereby breaking the limits of their
imaging imagination they change the

94
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:49,329
world but carefully hear me what M say I
learned what did I learn from the youth

95
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:57,579
of 11 million people I learnt the over
youth wants to be unique paper youth

96
00:09:57,579 --> 00:10:05,170
watch three unique that is you the over
you taught to be unique that is you but

97
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:11,769
the world around around you is doing it
best they might to make you just be

98
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:25,959
everybody else now whether you want to
be you re variants you you want to be

99
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:36,550
you not everybody else now if the coach
be like everybody else is convenient at

100
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:43,380
the first class but not satisfying in
the long vision the challenge there for

101
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:50,829
my young friends is that you have to
find hardest battle to fight the hardest

102
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:58,360
battle which any human being can never
imagine to fight and never stop fighting

103
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,649
until you
arrive at your destination dat is the

104
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:10,329
unique view to get to get the unique
view it's a big battle the battlements

105
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:14,709
you don't even take a garden the battle
means you have to have four unique

106
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:22,179
things for you know she must have that
battle one is your to set the goal the

107
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:28,149
second one is acquired the knowledge
continuously and third one it's a hard

108
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:33,189
work with the devotion and fourties
perseverance these are the tools you

109
00:11:33,189 --> 00:11:38,949
have to either before the battle the
video TV if you want with discoverers if

110
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:43,739
you want to be innovators I am going to
give you what type of what type of

111
00:11:43,739 --> 00:11:49,269
characteristic you must have the
invention and discoveries have Y

112
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:56,229
emanated from creativeminds that have
been constantly working and amazing the

113
00:11:56,229 --> 00:12:00,729
outcome the telephone he was amazing the
outcome you making the outcome in the

114
00:12:00,729 --> 00:12:06,159
mind with the imaging and constantly
effort all the forces of the universe

115
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:12,729
worked for that inspired mind thereby
leading to invention discoveries see I

116
00:12:12,729 --> 00:12:19,299
have the feeling whenever I do something
I feel happy you see this is you trying

117
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:26,649
and that whatever you may have knowledge
you hope sometimes better the economy

118
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:33,339
may have better better maybe sometimes
you have a kind words you can have so if

119
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:40,179
we use and make somebody's life happy
that you are giving and his or her life

120
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:44,310
is a happy that's a better bet the best
idea

121
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:51,180
because they that then you get a car to
conflict-free world that is leader

122
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:57,779
should work with integrity and succeed
with a better leader work with integrity

123
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:06,959
and succeed in London and I believe
president since you asked the question

124
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:13,889
has to be continuously in touch with the
people rush to the woman bare eyes I was

125
00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:19,259
there became a people spell and so
crossed over the women it becomes

126
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:26,309
people's power and also I travel into
the whole state cutting across Hill

127
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:32,480
deserts and see I was in touch with
millions and millions of
