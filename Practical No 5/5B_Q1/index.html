                            <em>First Let’s Get The Basics Right — Quantum Computers Are Not Like Our Traditional Computers</em>
                        </div>
                        <p >Quantum computers are more powerful than our traditional computers. However we can’t add more power to the traditional computers to make them into the quantum computers.</p>
                        <p>Turning a traditional computer into a quantum computer is like making a diesel car out of an electric car. Just like we can’t add more electrical engines into an electrical car to convert it into a diesel car, we cannot provide more power to a traditional computer to make it into a quantum computer.</p>
                        <p>Our traditional computers cannot solve the problems that the quantum computers can solve. This is because quantum computers are different. </p>
                        
                        <!-- Thematic Change (Use of hr tag) -->
                        <hr><p>Our traditional computers transmit data in binary format. Each character that you are seeing on this article can be written in binary format. The information that the computer transmits is a stream of electrical pulses which are known as bits. A bit is in one of the two states: either 0 or 1.</p>
                        <p>Quantum computers bits are known as Qubits, which can be in multiple states simultaneously.<br><strong><em> Qubit can be any state between 0 to 1 </em></strong></p>
                        <p>This very property of quantum computers make them different than our traditional computers. The property is known as superposition.<br><strong><em>Superposition is when a Qubit can be in multiple states at the same time</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Subsequently, if you were playing the game with a quantum computer then the quantum computer will always place itself in a superposition which will mean it is On and Off at the same time. Just before the results are tested, they would switch themselves into the winning state.<br> <strong><em>When the qubits are finally measured, they set themselves to one state and emerge as either being in state of 0 or 1</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Imagine you dilute orange juice in water. And then you build a machine to extract the juice out of the water. The diluted state is how Qubits are.</p>
                        <hr><p>This article explained the concept of quantum computing in an easy to understand manner. It also outlined the key differences between our traditional computers and super smart quantum computers.</p>
                        <p>IBM, Google, Rigetti, IonQ and also a large number of startups are investing into Quantum Computing. These are exciting advancements in our technological world.</p>
                        <p>Hope it helps.</p>
